Today marks my 1461st day as a software developer.

Funny how some things changed, while some never did, in a good way. There were times that I questioned my choices, but they all turned out that I just somehow forgot to look back to what made me want this in the first place: to express myself through codes and texts, and to solve problem that people and I have. Glad that the posts here reminded me of how ambitious I once was, and how practical I had come to be throughout the journey.

I would not say that it will get any easier, but I am excited to see what comes next and what I can offer, to myself, my friends around me, and this dear (hello) world.
