    Initial Setup on 2019/10/28 (Vim, Tmux)
</Figcaption>

My journey to Vim is rather a slowly one: about a week's worth of coding on side project to get the hang of it, enable Vim mode in VS Code for about a month to get use to the flow (with arrow keys from time to time...), and, onward to tinkering with config of terminal and Vim to get it a more IDE-like feel.

The current setup, on 2019/10/28, after tinkering with config file with a myriad of boilerplates for 2 days, is in the following:

For Terminal:

- Iterm2 - through Homebrew
- ZSH - through Homebrew

- [romkatv/powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - It has a really friendly [config wizard](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#configuration-wizard)!
- Tmux - through Homebrew
