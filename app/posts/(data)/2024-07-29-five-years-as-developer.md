Today marks my 1826th day as a software developer.

The pass year has been like a thrill ride to me personally yet rewarding:

- E2E tests can be fun and portable with [Cucumber](http://cucumber.io)
- Found out that [Go](https://go.dev) is such a gem: very performant and its design principles force effort from developer to write clean and maintainable code
- Got to try React Native out with [Expo](http://expo.dev)
- Spent some time on LeetCode as a refresher for algos and data structures
- Got to read a lot, tech or not

Hold tight and let's see what next year brings.
