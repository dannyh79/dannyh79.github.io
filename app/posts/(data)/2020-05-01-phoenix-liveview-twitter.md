Made a Twitter clone last weekend by following the tutorial from Chris McCord's, creator of the [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) that is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

It was really nice to have such feature without writing a single line of JavaScript; Phoenix and LiveView took care of all that for me. Hope I will get a hang of Elixir and learn how to harness the "magic" from LiveView real soon. ;)
