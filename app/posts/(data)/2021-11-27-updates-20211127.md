- Tried [tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum/), which helps create seamless tmux experiences, and got amazed by it
- Finally found a screenshot/annotation tool, [ksnip/ksnip](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip), that I considered fit for work
- Still trying to find a productive way to use a dual 27-inch monitor setup with monitor arms. Suggestions are welcomed
